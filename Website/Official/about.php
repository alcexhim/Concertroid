		<h1>who we are</h1>
		<p>
			We are a community dedicated to the creation and promotion of community-made virtual singer concerts.
			We develop our own software to facilitate concert production, as well as promote other software
			products whose aims are similar to ours. Our goal is to make it easy for everyone who wants to perform
			a virtual singer concert to be able to do so even under a limited budget and a small team.
		</p>
		<h1>quality assurance</h1>
		<p>
			We provide a specification for virtual singer concert production, recommending best practices and features so
			that every virtual concert produced by adherents to the specification will be of the utmost quality. Fan-made
			does not necessarily have to mean low-quality!
		</p>
		<h1>promoting the community</h1>
		<p>
			We would love to hear about your activities in the virtual singer community. Please
			<a href="register.php">register</a> with us! You can manage your event using Concertroid! Online's event management service. This will automatically feature your event on the front page when it is one of the top 3 events that will be presented next!

<h1>The Software</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Concertroid!</strong> is a software product which is the
	reference implementation for the specification. We strive to implement
	every detail of the specification, as well as throwing in our own
	unique twists and special features. <strong>Concertroid!</strong> was the
	first Polygon Movie Maker-compatible rendering engine to support
	<em>lights-off mode</em> and <em>animated textures</em>, which were later
	incorporated into other software. You can read more about
	<strong>Concertroid!</strong> and related software on the
	<a href="/a">Software</a> community page.
